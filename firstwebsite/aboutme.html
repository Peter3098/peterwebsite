    <p>Hi my name is Peter and this is my first website one I created from scratch during this quarantine so welcome to my first website and ill be showing whover gets to view this things ive done for my multimedia class such as my projects. A little introduction about me well im 22 years old living in new york specifically staten island shout out to wu tang clan and I go to Borough of manhattan community college my major is animation and motion graphics and I have no idea what im doing but its pretty fun so far so thats about it !!! 
    This is my first semester and its been going good my goal for the reason I choose this major is because I always have been interested in animation and some day hope to get better at it and be able to do projects myself in the future with my own ideas and well this is the journey till I get there so yeah hello and goodbye. </p>
